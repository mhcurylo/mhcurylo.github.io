## Personal summary

I am a polyglot functional programmer and enterprise software developer with a background in the philosophy of media and computing.

I have commercial full-stack experience designing and developing distributed web applications written in Haskell, Purescript, Java and TypeScript utilising agile methodologies, continuous integration and continuous deployment to Kubernetes clusters.

I solve business problems involving transformations of data. At the heart of what I do is understanding and communicating the flow, shape, content and consistency of data. I believe the code expressing the transformations should be well-typed, tested, efficient and malleable.

I have a keen interest in systems theory, company structures and the ability of teams and individuals to innovate, induce change and combat organisational inertia. I believe in continuous improvement of processes by both following rules and pondering them.

In my spare time, I like to play some Go, read a book, write a blog post, do some research or try out a new programming language. I have got a basic competence in Clojure, Idris, Kotlin, Scala and WebGL.


## Technical Profile

* Haskell microservices using Servant / Lenses / Higgledy / Barbie / Refined / postgresql-simple / wai as well as Template Haskell / Generic programming, CQRS and Event Sourcing
* Functional frontend experience with Purescript / React / Redux / Lenses, as well as Typescript / Angular / Redux / RxJS and React / React Hooks / fp-ts / fp-ts-io / Material-ui stacks
* Java microservices with Spring, OOP and Design Patterns.
* SQL (MySql and PostgreSQL) and Non-SQL (MongoDB) databases
* Big data streaming and processing in Google Cloud (Pub-Sub, Apache Beam, BigQuery)
* Data processing and visualisation in Haskell (Conduit, vector, containers, unordered-containers, GraphViz)
* Deploying, monitoring, troubleshooting and tuning Docker and Kubernetes microservices in production using Prometheus / Grafana
* Continous Integration and Deployment (Buildkite, Agrocd, GoCD, SonarQube, Ansible)
* Extensive testing experience in backend and frontend (including unit, integration, contract, e2e and property testing)
* Micro benchmarking and e2e performance testing and improvement using JMeter/JMH for Java and criterion/apib with Haskell
* Fundamentals of category theory inspired functional programming (Haskell, vavr.io for Java, fp-ts for TypeScript)


## Career History

### Habito

June 2019 - Present

Haskell Engineer

- A proud member of the team leading the charge to detach core internal systems from a monolith called Engine. Along the way, we have moved from Haskell/Spock to Haskell/Servant, from Purescript/React/Redux to Typescript/React/Hooks.
- Developing frontend and backend parts of a microservices system spanning across multiple REST Haskell/Servant backends, Conduit data pipelines and React/Typescript frontends, utilising PostgreSQL with CQRS and Event Sourcing. The system is build using Bazel/NixOS/Buildkite and delivered to Kubernetes cluster via GitOps/AggroCD. Our team sets up new standards in defining and testing contracts between services across the whole company.
- Lead a push for increase runtime awareness and improving build systems and Kubernetes deployments leading to enhancing the top 95th response time of detached services by order of magnitude as well as improving the performance of the old monolith system in 95th percentile by a factor of five. The improvements lead to saving tens of hours for both operations as well as our end users. The research led to internal workshops and Haskell eXchange 2020 talk.
- Advocating for and participating in the company transition from PureScript to TypeScript, as well as setting up code standards and best practises (including FE unit testing) in the team.
- Increased the performance of Conduit pipelines fivefold by introducing concurrency guaranteeing much faster failure recovery of the mission-critical system.
- Improved multiple old systems either by introducing data-driven unit testing, compile-time checks or increasing performance.
- Leading agile ceremonies and presenting the team accomplishments on department meetings.

### Gamesys Limited

January 2017 - June 2019

Fullstack developer

- Cooperated with TAs and PO on the design and implemented a financial data aggregation strategy using PubSub/Apache Beam/BigQuery/vavr.io.
- Introduced immutability, functional error handling, IO/pure function splitting and applicative validation to improve the reliability of Apache Beam projects.
- Worked on a Spring/Java/Kubernetes core microservices system delivered as a set of Docker images via GoCD/Ansible to Kubernetes cluster.
- Practised TDD with JUnit, E2E and performance testing of the whole system.
- Introduced Kotlin for succinct safe domain expression in mocks.
- Lead multiple internal Functional Programming workshops on both TypeScript and Java.

March 2016 - January 2017

Frontend developer

- Cooperated on an internal TypeScript/Angular2/RxJS SPA from the design phase to release.
- Designed and showcased prototypes in both Aurelia and React/Redux/Datascript.
- Introduced BDD testing using Mocha/Chai/Cucumber.b
- Lead workshops on Functional Programming in JavaScript/TypeScript.

### Cometari Dedicated Solutions

October 2015 - December 2015, contract

Frontend JavaScript in a fast-paced Agile environment

- Shipped SPA with Javascript/AngularJS/lodash/SCSS build with Grunt consuming RESTfull Java web services.
- Designed and developed a module for creating HTML complex input forms from JSON with AngularJS, lodash and JavaScript prototyping methods.
- Implemented dynamic and static pages based on wireframes with AngularJS/Bootstrap and AngularJS/Jeet.

### Heartland Games

October 2014 - October 2015, self-funded

Game designer/Game developer/Founder

- Designed, developed and shipped an AngularJS/Cordova game for mobile utilising SVG/WebAudio/Crosswalk.
- Integrated Cordova plugins to Angular app including analytic, in-app billing and AdMob.
- Designed, developed and delivered a promotional web page using Less/Bootstrap/SVG.
