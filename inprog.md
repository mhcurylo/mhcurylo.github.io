-- Plato's dilema. How to convince of a knowlabe world.

Contrary to a popular belief Plato did not propose a consistent theory of ideas. Instead he wished to wish one into being thorough a contrafactual reasoning. The premise, reformulated for software peoples to comprehend the madness of its ratio, goes somehow like that:
Given an object of knowledge, when it changes, then it invalidates all knowledge about it. Thus an object of knowledge, to be known, has to be pure and eternal and unchanging and always true. 
Here comes the contrafactual: either god uses `const's` to create a world of unchanging ideas and we can perceive the `const's` through reasoning or all philosopher's attempts at pure true eternal knowledge are doomed forever. 

Neither the scientific practices of naturalist philosophers which came before Plato or much more intricate proofs of contemporary Sophists stood a chance against the cone of survivor bias. Plato's reasoning divorced the idea of knowledge from the toll of practice and married it to a wager on the existence of the ethereal for centuries to come.

Since after the erasure of the contemporaries of Plato, philosophers, in order to know, must believe in the existence of eternal objects of knowledge.

Yet, software peoples are no philosophers. They do not perceive by the light of the reason, but by the palms of their hands. Software people are witches, weaving the instances of Canvas2D with the mechanical switches of linux terminals. A philosopher said that the point is not to interpret, but to change the world. Software witches do neither interpret nor change the world. They blend, mix and link the sources of open source libraries into new beings, daemons interpreting and acting upon the mortal worlds.

Software witch does not wager on gods, as she creates her own objects of knowledge. Thus, contrary to a philosopher, she has no need to have gods before her. It does not mean, fellow witches, that we have nothing to learn from the sages of yore. Quite the contrary. Even if Plat's wishful contrafactual is an immature wish, the solemn declaration still holds. Fixed and pure and true we call unalloyed knowledge has to do with the things which are eternally the same without change or mixture. It takes a lot less effort to understand that, what does not change. `Const` is easier to deal with than `var`. Yet, a witch does not have to place bet on the gods creating a knowable world. The whims of gods do not affect her, for she creates worlds of her know.

Whatever we can know our software is up to us, software peoples. We create our own objects of knowledge. The incomprehensible shantytowns we tend to dwell in are of our own making. [Big Balls of Mud] (http://laputan.org/mud/) we lurk in are as warm and cozy as unfathomable. The dynamic languages some of us weave between, around and all over can output anything but objects of unalloyed knowledge. Oh, code! Ever changing, ever accumulating, branched out, merged in, rebased, pulled and pushed. Code we link, code we import, code we depend on and code we will never comprehend. 

What makes code purer and truer and unnalloyed are types, what makes types purerer and truer is concrete data and what makes concrete data purer and truer and unalloyed are data schemas.



If there is anything that witches should learn from Plato philosopher is that what rarely changes - the data that a

It is up to them to create the slums  of monoliths etc.

How come we can do it?

The immutable - data, the mutable - code.
